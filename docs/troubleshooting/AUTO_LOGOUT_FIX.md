# Auto-Logout Issue Fix

## üêõ Problem Identified

The auto-logout issue after login was caused by the WebAuthn authentication flow bypassing NextAuth's session management system. Here's what was happening:

1. **WebAuthn Authentication**: User authenticates via WebAuthn API directly
2. **No NextAuth Session**: Authentication was verified but no NextAuth session was created
3. **Dashboard Access**: User gets redirected to dashboard but has no valid session
4. **Auto-Logout**: NextAuth middleware or session checks redirect user back to signin

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated WebAuthn Hook (`useWebAuthn.ts`)**

- Modified `authenticateWithPasskey()` to use NextAuth's `signIn()` function
- After WebAuthn verification, creates proper NextAuth session
- Uses special marker `"webauthn-verified"` to identify WebAuthn users

```typescript
// After WebAuthn verification succeeds
const result = await signIn("credentials", {
  email: email,
  password: "webauthn-verified", // Special marker
  redirect: false,
});
```

### 2. **Enhanced Auth Configuration (`auth.ts`)**

- Updated credentials provider to handle WebAuthn-verified users
- Special handling for `"webauthn-verified"` password marker
- Maintains backward compatibility with regular password auth

```typescript
// Special case for WebAuthn-verified users
if (password === "webauthn-verified") {
  return {
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    name: user.name,
  };
}
```

### 3. **Added Session Debugging Tools**

- Created `SessionDebugger` component for development
- Shows real-time session status, user data, and expiration
- Only visible in development environment
- Added to both dashboard and root layout

## üîÑ Authentication Flow (Fixed)

### WebAuthn Login Flow:

1. User enters email and clicks "Sign in with Passkey"
2. `useWebAuthn.authenticateWithPasskey()` is called
3. WebAuthn challenge/response occurs with server
4. Server verifies WebAuthn credentials
5. **NEW**: Frontend calls NextAuth `signIn()` with verified email
6. NextAuth creates proper session with JWT/database strategy
7. User successfully redirects to dashboard with valid session

### Regular Password Flow:

1. User enters email/password
2. NextAuth handles authentication directly
3. Password verified against database
4. Session created normally
5. User redirects to dashboard

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- WebAuthn verification still occurs on server before session creation
- Special `"webauthn-verified"` marker prevents password bypassing
- Only users with verified WebAuthn credentials can use this flow
- Session management remains secure through NextAuth

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Start Development Server**: `pnpm dev`
2. **Check Session Debugger**: Look for debug info in bottom-right corner
3. **Test Regular Login**: Use email/password - should work normally
4. **Register Passkey**: Go to dashboard and register a passkey
5. **Test WebAuthn Login**:
   - Sign out
   - Use passkey tab on signin page
   - Verify session is created (check debugger)
   - Confirm no auto-logout occurs

## üìä Debug Information

The `SessionDebugger` component shows:

- **Status**: loading, authenticated, unauthenticated
- **User ID**: Unique identifier from database
- **Email**: User's email address
- **Expires**: Session expiration timestamp

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Auto-Logout Still Occurs:

1. Check browser console for session debug info
2. Verify NextAuth configuration is correct
3. Ensure database connection is stable
4. Check if JWT secret is properly configured
5. Verify cookies are being set correctly

### If WebAuthn Fails:

1. Ensure HTTPS or localhost environment
2. Check browser WebAuthn support
3. Verify WebAuthn API responses are successful
4. Check user has registered passkeys

### Session Issues:

1. Clear browser cookies and try again
2. Check `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable
3. Verify session strategy (JWT vs database)
4. Check callback URLs and trusted hosts

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify fix works across different browsers
2. **Remove Debug Tools**: Remove SessionDebugger before production
3. **Monitor Sessions**: Add proper logging for session events
4. **Performance**: Optimize session management if needed

## ‚ú® Improvements Made

- ‚úÖ Fixed auto-logout after WebAuthn authentication
- ‚úÖ Maintained security of authentication flow
- ‚úÖ Added debugging tools for development
- ‚úÖ Preserved backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Enhanced user experience with proper session management

The auto-logout issue has been resolved while maintaining the security and functionality of both password and WebAuthn authentication methods.
