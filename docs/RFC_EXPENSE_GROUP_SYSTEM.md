# RFC: Expense and Group Management System

**Date**: August 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - 100% CORE FEATURES  
**Author**: Development Team  
**Reviewers**: ✅ All Requirements Met

## Summary

This RFC proposes the complete data model and architecture for the FairShare expense and group management system. The design supports both personal expense tracking and group-based expense sharing while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

## Motivation

The FairShare application needs a robust foundation for expense tracking that can handle:

- Personal expense tracking
- Group-based expense sharing
- **Multiple payer support** (e.g., split restaurant bill paid by 2 people)
- **Itemized expense support** (line-by-line breakdown of receipts)
- Complex split calculations
- Settlement tracking
- Multi-currency support (future)
- Receipt management
- Audit trails

The current system only has user authentication and preferences. We need to design a complete data model that won't require major refactoring as features are added incrementally.

## Design Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Flexibility**: Support both personal and group expenses seamlessly
2. **Multiple Payer Support**: Handle scenarios where multiple people pay for one expense
3. **Itemized Expenses**: Support line-by-line receipt breakdown for maximum fairness
4. **Scalability**: Handle complex splitting scenarios and large groups
5. **Auditability**: Track all changes and settlements
6. **Performance**: Efficient queries for balance calculations
7. **Extensibility**: Easy to add features like receipts, categories, etc.

### Real-World Scenarios Supported

**Multiple Payer Scenarios:**

- **Split Restaurant Bill**: Two people pay with separate cards for a group dinner
- **Shared Rent**: Multiple roommates pay portions of rent directly to landlord
- **Group Trip**: Different people pay for flights, hotels, and meals separately
- **Utilities**: Different people pay different utility bills for shared apartment
- **Large Purchases**: Multiple people contribute to expensive group items

**Itemized Expense Scenarios:**

- **Restaurant Receipts**: Individual meals + shared appetizers + proportional tax/tip
- **Grocery Shopping**: Personal items + shared household goods
- **Group Orders**: Individual purchases + shared shipping costs
- **Event Planning**: Specific services assigned to individuals + shared venue costs
- **Vacation Expenses**: Personal activities + shared accommodations/transportation

### Non-Goals (for initial implementation)

- Multi-currency support (designed for, not implemented)
- Advanced receipt OCR
- External payment integration
- Mobile-specific features

}
```

## Business Logic Design

### Expense Creation Flow

1. **Validation**

   - Total payer amounts equal expense total
   - All payer amounts > 0
   - If itemized: sum of all item amounts equals expense total
   - Valid participants for splits
   - Split amounts equal expense total (or item total for itemized)
   - User has permission to create expense in group

2. **Expense Types**

   - **Simple Expense**: Single amount with one split method
   - **Itemized Expense**: Multiple items, each with their own splits

3. **Split Calculation**

   - EQUAL: amount / participant_count
   - EXACT: use provided amounts
   - PERCENTAGE: amount \* (percentage / 100)
   - SHARES: amount \* (user_shares / total_shares)

4. **Database Transaction**
   - Create expense record
   - Create expense payer records for each person who paid
   - If simple: Create expense splits for each participant
   - If itemized: Create expense items and item splits
   - Update group balances (cached)

### Itemized Expense Logic

**Two-level splitting system:**

- **Expense Level**: Who paid the total amount
- **Item Level**: Who owes what for each individual item

**Example Restaurant Bill:**

```typescript
expense: {
  total: 127.50,
  payers: [{ userId: "alice", amount: 127.50 }],
  items: [
    { name: "Alice's burger", amount: 18.00, splits: [{ userId: "alice", amount: 18.00 }] },
    { name: "Bob's pasta", amount: 22.00, splits: [{ userId: "bob", amount: 22.00 }] },
    { name: "Shared appetizer", amount: 12.00, splits: [
      { userId: "alice", amount: 4.00 },
      { userId: "bob", amount: 4.00 },
      { userId: "charlie", amount: 4.00 }
    ]},
    { name: "Tax", amount: 7.65, splitMethod: "PERCENTAGE", splits: [...] },
    { name: "Tip", amount: 19.13, splitMethod: "PERCENTAGE", splits: [...] }
  ]
}
```

### Balance Calculation Algorithm

```typescript
interface UserBalance {
  userId: string;
  totalPaid: number;
  totalOwed: number;
  netBalance: number; // positive = owed money, negative = owes money
}

interface GroupBalance {
  groupId: string;
  members: UserBalance[];
  optimizedSettlements: Settlement[];
}
```

**Algorithm for Multiple Payers & Itemized Expenses**:

1. **Calculate Total Paid per User**:

   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, SUM(amount_paid) as total_paid
   FROM expense_payers ep
   JOIN expenses e ON ep.expense_id = e.id
   WHERE e.group_id = ? AND e.is_deleted = false
   GROUP BY user_id
   ```

2. **Calculate Total Owed per User**:

   - For simple expenses: Sum from expense_splits
   - For itemized expenses: Sum from expense_item_splits

   ```sql
   -- Simple expenses
   SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) as total_owed
   FROM expense_splits es
   JOIN expenses e ON es.expense_id = e.id
   WHERE e.group_id = ? AND e.is_deleted = false
   GROUP BY user_id

   UNION ALL

   -- Itemized expenses
   SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) as total_owed
   FROM expense_item_splits eis
   JOIN expense_items ei ON eis.item_id = ei.id
   JOIN expenses e ON ei.expense_id = e.id
   WHERE e.group_id = ? AND e.is_deleted = false
   GROUP BY user_id
   ```

3. **Compute Net Balances**: `netBalance = totalPaid - totalOwed`
4. **Generate Settlement Suggestions**: Use optimization algorithm below

### Settlement Optimization

For groups with multiple debts, use the following algorithm to minimize transactions:

```typescript
function optimizeSettlements(balances: UserBalance[]): Settlement[] {
  // Separate creditors (positive balance) and debtors (negative balance)
  const creditors = balances.filter((b) => b.netBalance > 0);
  const debtors = balances.filter((b) => b.netBalance < 0);

  const settlements: Settlement[] = [];

  // Greedy approach: match largest creditor with largest debtor
  while (creditors.length > 0 && debtors.length > 0) {
    const creditor = creditors[0];
    const debtor = debtors[0];

    const amount = Math.min(creditor.netBalance, Math.abs(debtor.netBalance));

    settlements.push({
      payerId: debtor.userId,
      payeeId: creditor.userId,
      amount,
    });

    creditor.netBalance -= amount;
    debtor.netBalance += amount;

    if (creditor.netBalance === 0) creditors.shift();
    if (debtor.netBalance === 0) debtors.shift();
  }

  return settlements;
}
```

## API Design

### Expense Endpoints

```typescript
// Create expense (Simple)
POST /api/expenses
{
  amount: number;
  description: string;
  date?: string;
  category?: ExpenseCategory;
  groupId?: string;
  splitMethod: SplitMethod;
  payers: {
    userId: string;
    amountPaid: number;
    paymentMethod?: string;
    paymentRef?: string;
  }[];
  participants: {
    userId: string;
    amount?: number;      // for EXACT splits
    percentage?: number;  // for PERCENTAGE splits
    shares?: number;      // for SHARES splits
  }[];
  notes?: string;
}

// Create itemized expense
POST /api/expenses
{
  amount: number;
  description: string;
  date?: string;
  category?: ExpenseCategory;
  groupId?: string;
  payers: {
    userId: string;
    amountPaid: number;
    paymentMethod?: string;
    paymentRef?: string;
  }[];
  items: {
    name: string;
    description?: string;
    amount: number;
    quantity?: number;
    unitPrice?: number;
    category?: string;
    isShared: boolean;
    splitMethod: SplitMethod;
    participants: {
      userId: string;
      amount?: number;
      percentage?: number;
      shares?: number;
    }[];
  }[];
  notes?: string;
}

// Get expenses (with filtering)
GET /api/expenses?groupId=123&category=FOOD&from=2025-01-01&to=2025-12-31

// Update expense
PUT /api/expenses/:id

// Delete expense (soft delete)
DELETE /api/expenses/:id
```

### Group Endpoints

```typescript
// Create group
POST /api/groups
{
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  currency?: string;
}

// Add member
POST /api/groups/:id/members
{
  userId?: string;
  email?: string; // for invitation
  role?: GroupRole;
}

// Get group balances
GET /api/groups/:id/balances

// Get settlement suggestions
GET /api/groups/:id/settlement-suggestions
```

### Settlement Endpoints

```typescript
// Create settlement
POST /api/settlements
{
  amount: number;
  payeeId: string;
  groupId?: string;
  expenseId?: string;
  method: SettlementMethod;
  description?: string;
}

// Confirm settlement
PUT /api/settlements/:id/confirm

// Get settlement history
GET /api/settlements?groupId=123&userId=456
```

## Security Considerations

### Authorization Rules

1. **Expense Access**

   - Users can only see expenses they're involved in (as payer or participant)
   - Group members can see all group expenses
   - Non-group members cannot access group expenses

2. **Group Management**

   - Only group owners/admins can modify group settings
   - Only group owners can delete groups
   - Members can leave groups voluntarily

3. **Settlement Creation**
   - Users can only create settlements they're part of
   - Group settlements require group membership
   - Settlement confirmation requires both parties' consent

### Data Validation

**Expense Validation:**

- Amount precision limited to 2 decimal places
- Sum of payer amounts must equal expense total amount
- All payer amounts must be > 0
- At least one payer required per expense

**Split Validation:**

- For simple expenses: split totals must equal expense amount
- For itemized expenses: sum of all item amounts must equal expense total
- Each item split total must equal item amount
- All split amounts must be ≥ 0

**Itemized Expense Validation:**

- Each item must have at least one participant
- Item names cannot be empty
- Item quantities must be > 0
- Unit prices (if provided) must match amount/quantity
- Date ranges within reasonable bounds
- File upload size and type restrictions for receipts

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

```sql
-- Critical indexes for query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_group_date ON expenses(group_id, date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_payer_user ON expense_payers(user_id, expense_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_payer_amount ON expense_payers(expense_id, amount_paid);
CREATE INDEX idx_split_user_settled ON expense_splits(user_id, is_settled);
CREATE INDEX idx_settlement_parties ON settlements(payer_id, payee_id, created_at);

-- Itemized expense indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_item_expense ON expense_items(expense_id, is_shared);
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_item_category ON expense_items(category, expense_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_item_split_user ON expense_item_splits(user_id, is_settled);
CREATE INDEX idx_item_split_item ON expense_item_splits(item_id, amount);
```

### Caching Strategy

1. **Balance Calculations**: Cache group balances, invalidate on expense changes
2. **User Sessions**: Cache user's groups and recent expenses
3. **Settlement Suggestions**: Cache expensive calculations

## Questions and Discussion Points

1. **Currency Precision**: Should we support more than 2 decimal places for crypto or certain currencies?

2. **Group Size Limits**: What's the maximum reasonable group size? How does this affect performance?

3. **Settlement Deadlines**: Should we implement automatic settlement reminders or deadlines?

4. **Expense Editing**: Should we allow editing expenses after settlements are made? How to handle the complexity?

5. **Data Retention**: How long should we keep deleted expenses and settlement history?

6. **Audit Trail**: Do we need a separate audit log table for regulatory compliance?
